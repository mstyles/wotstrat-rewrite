            <h2>WotStrat is live!</h2>
                <p>
                Today marks the official launch of WotStrat, welcome! The purpose of this site is
                simply to house whatever various projects I have relating to World of Tanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first of these out of the gate is <em><strong>Tank vs. Tank</strong></em>, a relatively simple (for now) tool
                for comparing the characteristics of several tanks side by side. It has filters for
                nation, tier, and class to make it easy to find the tank you want and compare it with its peers.
                This is really a beta release for it, as there are still a few minor kinks here and there that
                will be sorted out shortly. Suggestions for it are more than welcome,
                just go to the <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> page!
                </p>
                <p>
                I have a bunch more planned for things I want to do here, so check in every once in a while
                and you'll probably see some new stuff being added or improved.
                </p>
